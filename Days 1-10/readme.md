### 100 Days of Code - Days 1-10
#

Day 1: March 3rd 2023

Today's Progress: The first 10 days are going to be spent looking at the fundamentals of Java. I will be looking at classes, objects and methods at a very low level and do a little bit of console printing and assigning and using different data types and variables. As a starting point I am reading through and completing the challenges on [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-basic-syntax/?ref=lbp).

Thoughts: I enjoyed learning about the different data types available in Java, having come from python I am used to not having to declare data types when working with variables so look forward to learning which data types should be used and when.
