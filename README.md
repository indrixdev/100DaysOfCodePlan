# 100 Days Of Code Templates

General outline of the path to be followed for this attempt at the 100 Days of code challenge.

I will be following the path as defined at this [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-code-a-complete-guide-for-beginners-and-experienced/) post. It is a little more streamlined and I am hoping that it will help me stay focussed on learning a new language without going to deep down rabbit holes and spending too much time in the wrong areas.
