# 100 Days Of Code Plan

Welcome to my Repo for the 100 days of code challenge. Here I will be documenting all of the steps I take over the next 100 days to learn Java from scratch. I have attempted this challenge once before and unfortunately failed around ten days in due life. I am however back on track and would like to give this challenge another run.

I will be following the path as defined at this [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/100-days-of-code-a-complete-guide-for-beginners-and-experienced/) post. It is a little more streamlined and I am hoping that it will help me stay focussed on learning a new language without going to deep down rabbit holes and spending too much time in the wrong areas.

Day 0: March 2nd 2023

Today's Progress: Today is all about setting up what I need for the challenge. I will be downloading and setting up a Java environment using the [Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows). I will be using this as I like the customizable options for Jetbrains IDE's and as a student I get the Ultimate edition for free under student license. I will also be downloading and setting up Java on my PC and running some commands to test that everything is working as required.

Thoughts: I will be adding some thoughts on each of the steps I take, what I found hard, what I found easy and where relevant I will add links to the resources I have used to solve any issues I was having. I will try to keep these notes to the point though there will be code to go with each of the days I will try to keep the code commented on anywhere I feel will make sense.
